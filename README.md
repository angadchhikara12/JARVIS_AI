# JARVIS

This is JARVIS, and yes correct guess. It's named after the AI model of Tony Start aka. Iron Man J.A.R.V.I.S. This AI model is slightly different. This AI model is build for Ethical Hacking on Windows OS. If you are using some other OS than Windows/PC, only thing I can tell y'all is to wait. Because this thing will be having Version!!. Yes, this repo is going to be my first versioned Repo. If you guys want, use it, fork it, edit it, re-upload it. I don't care. Because it's the base I build. with just under 60 lines of code. This AI model uses TinyLlama. This model is imported using HuggingFace's Transformers. I want to give special thanks to HuggingFace and TinyLlama to make this happen for FREE!!💸💸. Yes, not even a single penny was spend to make this AI.

### THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR SUPPORT!
