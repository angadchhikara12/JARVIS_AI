# 🧠 JARVIS — Voice-Interactive AI Assistant

**JARVIS** is inspired by the iconic AI from Marvel’s *Iron Man* and *Avengers* movies.  
This project brings a similar experience to your system — an intelligent, conversational voice assistant powered by modern AI.

JARVIS uses **Gemini 2.0** for natural language understanding and response generation, and **ElevenLabs v2** for realistic, human-like voice output. The assistant listens through your microphone and responds through your speakers to create an immersive voice-based interaction.

If your device does not have a microphone or speaker, don’t worry — upcoming versions will include additional interaction modes for improved accessibility.
