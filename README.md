# JARVIS

Yes, it must be a well-known name. I am pretty sure that everyone knows what JARVIS is. If you don't, then let me expose this thing to everyone. It is an AI model that actually talks like J.A.R.V.I.S from the Iron Man movies and Avengers, probably🤷🏻. So what this AI Model does is it takes user input from the mic and returns the response through the speaker by speaking —if you don't have a mic or speaker or both, not my problem. Just kidding, I will try to include as my updates/upgrades as I can in further updated versions.
